## Abstract

The HIP defines an application network run set of parties in order to faciliate HBAR and HTS token transfers from Hedera to Ethereum and vice-versa.

## Motivation 

The recent release of HTS and the growing ecosystem growth seen on Ethereum, it seems that a Bridge Network between Hedera and Ethereum will be highly beneficial to the community. The current value stored on Hedera (HBARs/HTS) would become available on Ethereum.
On the other hand, tokens on Ethereum can be transferred to Hedera to utilise the high-troughput and low-fees that the network provides. The effect will be net positive for both Hedera and Ethereum native assets.
Bridges are inherently untrusted, since there are no efficient and completely trustless bridge setups. In one way or another, users must have trust assumptions on the entities/parties operating the Bridge.
The best way to successfully integrate a bridge network would be through the community and that is why this HIP is inteded for. Using this HIP, the community will have full transperency in both the design and the operations of the bridge.
